      A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...<br/>
      There was a software engineer who wanted to explore the powers of
      the dark side of the force.<br/>
      <br/>
      So he embarked on a journey across the web and encountered many
      strange creatures who spoke languages of HTML, JavaScript, and
      CSS.<br/>
      <br/>
      In one of those journeys, one unfortunate enough to come across
      him beheld this mighty warrior wielding a formidable weapon, the
      one which was spoken of in ancient lore to be able to level
      entire civilizations with one strike.<br/>
      <br/>
      Cryptography, and the determining of very large prime factors,
      was behind this powerful force...<br/>
